      `I'm in this IT field  since I was 14 years old. I didn't know what full-stack meant at that time because the term was not coined back then. I'm so out of content right now that I'm literally crying writing this text since lorem text is so 2017 now.`,
      `After learning HTML and struggling with CSS, I came up with a brilliant idea of using bootstrap so that I don't have to style everything by myself and - for obvious reasons - if you knew bootstrap, you were cool.`,
      `But now, I'm a legend. I've been coding in React, Nextjs, Node.js, Express, MongoDB, MySQL,MUI Bootstrap, Tailwind, Python, and YouDontKnowShit programming language etc to name a few. Although I barely know the syntax (Psst, Stack overflow!), I consider myself a Ninja developer I'm laughing right now.`,
